### Project Report: Predicting Medical Charges Using Machine Learning

---

#### **Description**
The project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict healthcare charges based on various personal and medical factors. By analyzing real-world medical data, this project seeks to understand how factors such as age, BMI, smoking status, sex, and the number of children influence healthcare costs. The primary goal is to build a predictive model that accurately estimates the healthcare charges for new individuals based on their input attributes.

This project can provide valuable insights for healthcare providers and insurance companies, aiding in pricing strategies and personalized care recommendations by predicting future charges.
